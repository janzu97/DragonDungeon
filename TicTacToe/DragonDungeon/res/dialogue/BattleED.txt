The dragon collapses before you.
Silently you watch as life slowly fades from its eyes.
You feel relieved.
Against all odds you managed to survive.
You take another look at the dragon.
Blood slowly flows from the cuts all over its body.
Some of its scales have been burned off by your magic.
It's eyes which not long ago wrought terror into your very being
now only inpire pity in you.
Sure it had tried to kill you
but thats onl to be espected after all
the dragon was merely a beast driven
by its primal urges.



It was a majestic beast.
your thoughts start to stray.
I wonder if there are more like it.
You start cutting the dragons head off.
as you press your knife to the dragons head,
it lets out its last cry, not a roar but
a wimper.


Start walking out the cave.

Suddenly a large stone fall from the cealing.
you try to dodge it but you are not fast enough.
and so it ends with a thump.
