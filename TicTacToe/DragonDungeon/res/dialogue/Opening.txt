You stand in the middle of a dark cave. You have been tasked to slay
the beast that inhabits this craven cavern.
You spot a shadow in the distance.
A freezing chill runs through your spine.
The shadow has two bright red eyes.
the creature is fixated onto you.
 It's eyes are like smoldering embers burning deep into your core.
creature draws closer.

Earth trebles under it's feet.
You finally get a good look at it.
It's a dragon!

You hesitate for a moment before taking a stance.


You will not die here.
